In this post, I'd like to share some work related to geo-spatial mapping, 
statewide school ratings, and US Census Bureau data using census tracts. 
Specifically, I wanted to investigate whether there was a relation between the
median housing price in an area, and the statewide achievement ratings for 
schools in the corresponding area. There is a 
[strong relation](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/may-sreardon.pdf)
between socio-economic status and student achievement, but less is known about
how statewide ratings for schools relate to the demographics of the 
corresponding area. This is a rather long post, so you'll have to have a bit
of endurance to get through it all (I considered splitting it into two posts
but it felt less cohesive).

This post uses the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and 
[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) packages, as well the terrific 
[tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) package by Kyle Walker in 
conjunction with [sf](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). The 
[ggmap](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) package is used for pulling 
lattitude and longitude data from physical addresses. Finally, this post 
builds off a [wonderful post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/using-tidycensus/) by 
Julia Silge.

## The data
For this project, I wanted to use only publicly available data. I meandered 
around the Oregon Department of Education (ODE) website for a while and eventually
came to the file I wanted: [Report Card Ratings for each school](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/reportcards/reportcards/Pages/Accountability-Measures.aspx).
If you've explored my R course slides at all you know I'm a fan of Thomas 
Leeper's *rio* package for data import. It just makes things easy. So let's 
import the data directly from the ODE website and take a look.

```{r import_rcdetails}
# load packages for data import/prep
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(janitor)

ratings <- import("http://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/reportcards/reportcards/Documents/rcdetails_1617.xlsx",
                  setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
            clean_names()

# Clean up the file to what we need
ratings <- ratings %>% 
  filter(district_name == "Portland SD 1J") %>% 
  spread(indicator, rating) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(school_name, achievement) %>% 
  mutate(achievement = parse_number(achievement)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(achievement))
	
ratings
```

In the above code, we import the ratings, filter for only schools in Portland
School District, spread the data out so we have column for the achievement 
ratings, and then select only the two variables we really need - the school
name and the achievement rating.This is a good start, but we don't yet have the 
geographical coordinates of the schools. To do that, we'll get another dataset 
from ODE that has the physical address of each school. We'll then transform 
those addresses to lattitude and longitude using a bit of help from google. 
First, the addresses:

```{r import_addresses}
addresses <- import("http://www.ode.state.or.us/pubs/labels/SchoolMail.xls",
                    setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(city == "PORTLAND") %>% 
  mutate(name = str_to_title(name)) %>% 
  unite(address, c(address, city, state, zip), sep = " ") %>% 
  select(name, address)
              
addresses
```

We'll now join the *addresses* dataset with our *ratings* dataset, which we 
know contains only the schools in Portland School District.

```{r join}
d <- inner_join(ratings, addresses, by = c("school_name" = "name"))
d
```

Now, we can find the longitude and lattitude of each school using the physical
address with the help of the *ggmap* package and, specifically, the `geocode`
function.

```{r lat_long}
library(ggmap)
lat_long <- geocode(d$address, source = "dsk")
d <- bind_cols(d, lat_long)
d
```

## Mapping the data
To map the data, we'll use the *leaflet* package. We'll first write a quick
function that tells leaflet what color we want the schools in our map to appear
depending on their statewide achievement rating.

```{r label}
library(leaflet)

get_col <- function(df, indicator) {
  sapply(df[[as.character(indicator)]], function(rating) {
    if(rating == 5) {
      "green"
    } else if(rating == 4) {
      "lightgreen"
    } else if(rating == 3) {
      "white"
    } else if(rating == 2) {
      "lightred"
    } else {
      "red"
    } })
}
```


Next we'll map the Portland area using the *tidycensus* and *sf* packages. Note
that you have to have a US Census API key for these function to work.
The `get_acs` function gets census tracts for  Multnomah County. The
variable argument tells the function to get information about the median housing
cost of the area. See other variables with the `load_variables` function from
the package. The `colorNumeric` function creates a pallete according to the
estimate for the tract with the viridis palette (which not only looks nice but
has good properties for color blindness and printing in black and white).

```{r tidycensus}
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)

pdx_acs <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
                     variables = "B25077_001", 
                     state = "OR",
                     county = "Multnomah County",
                     geometry = TRUE)

pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "viridis", 
                    domain = pdx_acs$estimate)
```

Finally, we produce the map. I'll come back to this tomorrow morning to explain 
the rest of the code but it's currently near 11:00 PM and I'm tired so I'm going 
to sleep.

```{r icons, eval = FALSE}
icons <- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'ios-close',
  iconColor = 'black',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = get_col(d, "achievement")
)

cols <- gplots::col2hex(c("red", "pink", "white", "lightgreen", "darkgreen"))

pdx_acs %>%
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addPolygons(popup = ~ str_extract(NAME, "^([^,]*)"),
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0,
              fillOpacity = 0.7,
              color = ~ pal(estimate)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", 
            pal = pal, 
            values = ~ estimate,
            title = "Median Home Value",
            labFormat = labelFormat(prefix = "$"),
            opacity = 1) %>% 
  addAwesomeMarkers(data = d, 
                    ~lon, 
                    ~lat, 
                    icon = icons, 
                    popup= ~school_name) %>% 
  addLegend("bottomright", 
            colors = rev(cols),
            labels = 5:1,
            title = "Achievement Ratings",
            opacity = 1)
```

```{r map_save, echo = FALSE}
