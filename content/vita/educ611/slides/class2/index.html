# What is validity?

--

* The truth of, correctness of, or degree of support for an **inference**
* Inferences are or are not valid (not the study, method, measure, etc.)

--

### Internal validity

How trustworthy are the results of the study?

.pull-right[
### External validity

To what extent do the results generalize beyond the specific sample used in the study?

---
## Internal Validity

--

* Degree to which study conclusions are warranted

--

* Degree to which plausible rival explanations are ruled out

--

* Are the results of the study *really* due to the phenomena under investigation

---
## Threats to Validity

* Any specific reason an inference could be partly or totally wrong
  + Difficulty to assess all plausible threats a priori
* Specific designs are more susceptible than others

---
## Threats to Internal Validity

From Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002

In sets of Three. Why? 🤷

--

1. Ambiguous temporal precedence

--

  + Lack of clarity as to which occurred first

--

1. Selection

--

  + Systematic differences over conditions that could result in the observed effect

--
  
1. History

--

  + Events occurring concurrently w/treatment that could result in the observed effect
  
---

1. Maturation

--

  + Naturally occurring changes that could be confused with treatment
  
--

1. Regression

--

  + Extreme scores naturally migrating toward the mean
  
--

1. Attrition

--

  + Non-random loss of participants
  
---

1. Testing

--

  + Exposure to a test can effect subsequent test scores
  
--

1. Instrumentation

--

  + Psychometric concerns
  
--

1. Additive and Interactive Effects

--

  + Impact of one threat may be added to another, or depend on the level of another
  
--

1. Diffusion

--
  + Members of the control/comparison group receive the treatment

# Scenario 1

&gt; A group of researchers are interested in the relation between
screen-time (TV, computer, iPad, phones, etc.) and academic achievement for
third grade students. They send a survey home with students in three
classrooms in one school asking the
parents to approximate how many minutes their child spends on each of multiple
devices each day. They then sum the total minutes and correlate the estimated
daily totals with students' grades in reading and math. The authors want to 
make claims about how an increase in screen time relates to academic
achievement.

* Identify at least three threats to the internal validity of this study.
  + Focus on internal validity only - not on whether the results would
  generalize.
* Identify at least three ways the study could be improved.
  + Record these responses for part of what you upload tonight.

👀 Does this change your thoughts on the study? 👀

---
# Scenario 2

&gt; Given the relation the researchers observed from the first study, they
designed an intervention aimed at reducing screen time. The researchers
provided the intervention to all students in two of the three classrooms at the
school, but the students had changed (new school year). One month later they
sent the same survey they had used before home to parents. They compared the
screen time for students who did and did not receive the intervention. This 
time they want to make claims about the effect of their intervention on screen
time.

# External Validity


---
# External Validity
* Not to be confused with internal validity

&gt; "concerns inferences about the extent to which a causal relationship holds over variations in persons, settings, treatments, and outcomes" (p. 83)

---
# Threats to External Validity

1. Interaction of the causal relationship with units

--

  + Effect is found with certain kinds of units but not others
  + Works for boys, what about girls?
  
--

1. Interaction of the causal relationship over treatment variations

--

  + An effect found with some variations, but not others
  + Reducing class size may only work when accompanied by new funding to build new classrooms
  
--

1. Interaction of the causal relationship over outcomes

--

  + An effect observed with one outcome (easyCBM math), doesn't hold for others (state math test)

---

1. Interaction over settings

--
  
  + An effect found in one setting does not generalize to others
  + urban/rural
  
--

1. Context-dependent mediation

--

  + A mediator of the causal relation may be present in one context, but not another

# How do you control for threats to validity?

--
### Randomness

![](assets/img/randomness.jpg)

---
# Random Assignment

.gray[(And now we're moving into sampling)]

* The process of randomly selecting individuals (or units, in the case of a cluster-randomized trial) *from the sample* into treatment and control conditions. 
* Randomness guarantees that, on average over repeated samples, the differences between treatment and control will be zero

---
# Illustrating the process

&lt;br/&gt;

## Beyond the basics

---
# Types of samples

Broadly, samples can be broken down into two basic categories: **probability** and **non-probability** based samples.

--

+ **Probability-based samples**: Every member in the population has an equal chance of being in the sample

--

+ **Non-probability-based samples**: Every member in the population **does not** have an equal chance of being in the sample

--
### Which do you think is more common? Why?

---
class:inverse center middle

# Types of probability samples

---
# Simple random sample
If we imagine that the simulation earlier was a *population* of 100, then the sampling procedure would be equivalent to a simple random sample, or SRS.

--

.center[&lt;img src= assets/img/lotto.jpg style="width:400px"&gt;]

--
### Why is this a probability-based sample?

---
# Challenges to SRS (discuss)

--
* Generally do not have access to the full population to make them a part of the SRS

--
* Even if you do, many may decline to be in the research

--
* Sometimes (usually?) it is literally impossible to have every individual from the population in your sample (particularly if you're interested in what things will be like in the future, which is most of the time)

--
* Sometimes, particular groups may be of particular interest, and those groups may over-/under-represented by SRS

---
# Stratified Random Sampling

Any guesses as to what it is?

--
* Essentially, split the sample by some characteristic of interest (e.g., race/ethnicity). Then use SRS within each split. 

---
* As stated previously, simple random samples are often **infeasible**, and possibly even **impossible**

--
* Guarantees representative proportions by the specific characteristics 
  + Some studies may purposefully over-sample specific groups to guard against
  attrition

--

.center[&lt;img src= assets/img/lotto.jpg style="width:400px"&gt;]

---
# Cluster Sampling

Any guesses as to what it is?

--
* Select samples at the cluster level

--
* Randomly sample *schools*, or *classrooms*, etc.

--
* Can be a helpful way to solve many practical problems
  + Recruitment may be easier
  + Diffusions concerns mitigated

--
* Also complicates the analysis
  + Multilevel modeling a must

# Sampling Practice
The purpose of this exercise is not to give you a deep understanding of how
sampling  works. Rather, it is to give you a better conceptual understanding of
the techniques.

.pull-left[
### Excel commands
* Type `=RAND()` in a cell. A random number will appear.
* Copy this formula to all cells 
* Copy all the random number, then
`edit -&gt; Paste Special -&gt; values`. (I will demo)
* Sort by the random number, and select the top *n* cases
]

.pull-right[
### Your assignment
* Open *mtcars.xlsx*
* Try to take a simple random sample of 5 cars
* Use stratified random sampling to sample 3 cars within each cylinder type 
* Use cluster sampling to randomly select two `carb` categories. Which cars are represented?

# Types of non-probability samples

---
# Convenience samples
* By far the most common
  + Bethel says they'll let us test a reading intervention, so we're going to Bethel!
* Can still be powerful for inferences around treatment effectiveness
* External validity is limited


---
# Quota sampling

.gray[not used in ed research much]

* Need a sample of X people from each of Y groups
  + e.g., Differential item functioning study
  + Need at least 500 people in each group OR
  + Need 50 people in each group for every possible score on the test (even better)

--

* Often used in business marketing research


---
# Chain/Snowball sampling

.gray[also not used in ed research much]

* Participants exit the study and recommend somebody else to participate

## Validity
]

--

* How have we been defining validity so far?

--

* How do you think this differs for measurement?

---
#  How do we go about saying a test is valid? 

--

### We don’t!

--

* Validity is not a property of the test. Validity is...

&gt; an overall evaluative judgment of the *degree*  to which empirical evidence and theoretical rationales support the adequacy and appropriateness of *interpretations* *and* *actions*  on the basis of test scores or other modes of assessment 

( Messick , 1995, p. 741, emphasis added)

So, what does that mean?

---
#  Validity 

+ Rather than trying to show that a test is or is not valid, we collect evidence that a test does or does not do what it’s supposed to do under the intended circumstances .
	+ How do we do that? 

---
#  Types of Validity Evidence 

+ Face Validity
	+ The test “looks” like it should. Key stakeholders believe the test to be an adequate measure.

--

+ Criterion-related Validity (Predictive &amp; Concurrent)
	+ Assessment relates to key criteria.

--

+ Content Validity
	+ The critical content for the test is appropriately sampled.

--

+ Construct Validity
	+ Holistic judgment. How well does the test measure the intended construct? 

--

+ Consequential Validity
	+ Social consequences of the use of a particular test (debated).

#  Validity and Test Bias 

+ Can a test be valid if specific groups of students (e.g., students eligible for free or reduced lunch as opposed to those who are not ) routinely score lower than others?

--

+ What makes a test biased? How does bias relate to validity?

---
#  Test Bias 

+ How do we evaluate if a test is biased?
	+ One approach: Differential item functioning.
	+ Another approach: Invariance testing.

+ Simple, clear, and intuitive instructions and procedures.
+ Maximum readability and comprehensibility.
+ Maximum legibility of text, tables, figures, and illustrations

(see Thompson, Johnstone, and Thurlow, 2002)

---
#  Reliability 

Just as a test cannot be valid if it is biased, a test cannot be valid if it is not reliable.
+ What is reliability?

&gt; reliability is concerned solely with how the scores resulting from a measurement procedure would be expected to vary across replications of that procedure” 

( Haertel , 2006).

--

+ Can a test be reliable but not valid?

--

+ How do we document test reliability?


---
# Internal Consistency

.pull-left[
Coefficient alpha
+ Commonly referred to as Cronbach’s alpha
+ Ranges from 0-1.0
+ Measures the degree to which items “hang together”
]

.pull-right[
![](assets/img/cronbach.png)
]

---
# Acceptable values?

* Depends on context, but generally at least &gt; .7, with higher values indicating more consistency

---
#  Other types of reliability 

+ Test-retest reliability
	+ Scores correlated

--

+ Alternate-form reliability
	+ Scores correlated

--

+ Split-half reliability
  + Coefficient alpha calculated for each half, halves correlated

--

+ Inter-rater reliability
	+ How consistently do different raters judge the same artifact?

--

+ IRT-based indicators
  + My favorite: Conditional reliability

# Qualitative approach?

* Qualitative research also measures things, just not quantitatively
* Validity argument still remains, but the focus is different
  + Generally on the procedures, etc.
  + Reliability can still be a concern (e.g., different coding practices between researchers could lead to different themes emerging)
+ Qualitative research often still uses surveys or focus groups with guided questions
  + Validity of questions needs to be established
