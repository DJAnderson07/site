This is a course I co-taught during the summer of 2018. The topics on which I
lectured were:

* [Research basics and threats to internal/external validity](../slides/class1/)
* Sampling and measurement
* Quantitative research: RCTs & quasi-experimental designs
* Review, Article Critique, and midterm

Each of the above links to the lecture slides.
