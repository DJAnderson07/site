## Agenda
* Basics of string data
* String operators
	+ Cover both *stringr* and *base functions*
* Special characters
* Pattern matching

----
## Before we get started
* In many cases, I've opted to show both base and *stringr* functions
* *stringr* is part of the tidyverse, and has some nice functionality, but many of the base functions are so common I think I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't also introduce them.
* There are some *stringr* functions that are far easier than the base alternative, so I'll skip base on them (e.g., `str_extract()`).

----
## Some properties of strings

* Strings can be anything wrapped in quotes
* All of the below are strings


```r
"TRUE"
"1"
"a"
"4.78"
"purple"
```

----
* Strings are the most flexible data type. Can be coerced to other types if it makes sense
(the below spits out warnings)


```r
as.double(c("TRUE", "1", "a", "4.78", "purple"))
```

```
## [1]   NA 1.00   NA 4.78   NA
```

```r
as.logical(c("TRUE", "1", "a", "4.78", "purple"))
```

```
## [1] TRUE   NA   NA   NA   NA
```

----
## Vectors must be of the same type
* This implies that if you have a character element in an atomic vector, all will be coerced to character (because it's the most flexible)


```r
c("string", 1.45, TRUE, 5L)
```

```
## [1] "string" "1.45"   "TRUE"   "5"
```

----
## Factors

* Factors may not behave as you'd expect


```r
c(factor("a"), "b", 1, 4.59)
```

```
## [1] "1"    "b"    "1"    "4.59"
```

* Why do you think this is happening?
* How could we get this to do what we intend? (i.e., return "a")

----
## Overriding factors


```r
c(as.character(factor("a")), "b", 1, 4.59)
```

```
## [1] "a"    "b"    "1"    "4.59"
```

---- 
# String data for today

----
## Strings to process


```r
library(stringr) # loaded with the tidyverse as of version 1.2.0
fruit
sentences
words
```

----
## fruit


```r
head(fruit)
```

```
##  [1] "apple"             "apricot"           "avocado"          
##  [4] "banana"            "bell pepper"       "bilberry"         
```

----
## sentences


```r
head(sentences)
```

```
##   [1] "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."               
##   [2] "Glue the sheet to the dark blue background."              
##   [3] "It's easy to tell the depth of a well."                   
##   [4] "These days a chicken leg is a rare dish."                 
##   [5] "Rice is often served in round bowls."                     
##   [6] "The juice of lemons makes fine punch."                    
```

----
## words


```r
head(words)
```

```
##   [1] "a"           "able"        "about"       "absolute"    "accept"     
##   [6] "account"   
```

---- 
# String operators 

---- 
## Make everything upper case

# stringr


```r
str_to_upper(fruit[1:5])
```

```
##  [1] "APPLE"             "APRICOT"           "AVOCADO"          
##  [4] "BANANA"            "BELL PEPPER"       
```


# base


```r
toupper(fruit[1:5])
```

```
##  [1] "APPLE"             "APRICOT"           "AVOCADO"          
##  [4] "BANANA"            "BELL PEPPER"       
```

---- 
## Make everything lower case

# stringr


```r
str_to_lower(sentences[1:5])
```

```
##   [1] "the birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."               
##   [2] "glue the sheet to the dark blue background."              
##   [3] "it's easy to tell the depth of a well."                   
##   [4] "these days a chicken leg is a rare dish."                 
##   [5] "rice is often served in round bowls."                     
```


# base


```r
tolower(sentences[1:5])
```

```
##   [1] "the birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."               
##   [2] "glue the sheet to the dark blue background."              
##   [3] "it's easy to tell the depth of a well."                   
##   [4] "these days a chicken leg is a rare dish."                 
##   [5] "rice is often served in round bowls."                     
```

---- 
## Make title case
Notice these are slightly different

# stringr

```r
str_to_title("big movie that is really amazing")
```

```
## [1] "Big Movie That Is Really Amazing"
```


# base (tools package - comes pre-installed)

```r
tools::toTitleCase("big movie that is really amazing")
```

```
## [1] "Big Movie that is Really Amazing"
```

----
## Other options?
Look at `?toupper`


```r
.simpleCap <- function(x) {
    s <- strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]
    paste(toupper(substring(s, 1, 1)), substring(s, 2),
          sep = "", collapse = " ")
}
.simpleCap("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog")
```

```
## [1] "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Brown Dog"
```
Which mimics `str_to_title` rather than `tools::toTitleCase`.


```r
tools::toTitleCase("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog")
```

```
## [1] "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Brown Dog"
```

---- 
## Join strings together

# stringr

```r
str_c("green", "apple")
```

```
## [1] "greenapple"
```

```r
str_c("green", "apple", sep = " ")
```

```
## [1] "green apple"
```

```r
str_c("green", "apple", sep = " : ")
```

```
## [1] "green : apple"
```


# base

```r
paste0("green", "apple")
```

```
## [1] "greenapple"
```

```r
paste("green", "apple")
```

```
## [1] "green apple"
```

```r
paste("green", "apple", sep = " : ")
```

```
## [1] "green : apple"
```


----
## Joining strings w/vectors


```r
str_c("a", c("b", "c", "d"), 1:3)
```

```
## [1] "ab1" "ac2" "ad3"
```

```r
str_c("a", c("b", "c", "d"), c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3))
```

```
## [1] "ab1" "ac1" "ad1" "ab2" "ac2" "ad2" "ab3" "ac3" "ad3"
```

* Note, the last vector could be created with `rep(1:3, each = 3)`
* Base version is the same but with `paste0`

----
## Collapsing strings


```r
str_c("a", c("b", "c", "d"), 1:3, collapse = "|")
```

```
## [1] "ab1|ac2|ad3"
```

```r
str_c("a", c("b", "c", "d"), c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3), collapse = ":")
```

```
## [1] "ab1:ac1:ad1:ab2:ac2:ad2:ab3:ac3:ad3"
```

--- 
## Calculate string length


```r
words[1:3]
```

```
## [1] "a"     "able"  "about"
```


# stringr

```r
str_length(words[1:3])
```

```
## [1] 1 4 5
```



# base

```r
nchar(words[1:3])
```

```
## [1] 1 4 5
```

---- 
## substrings: stringr


```r
words[10:13]
```

```
## [1] "active"  "actual"  "add"     "address"
```


```r
str_sub(words[10:13], 3)
```

```
## [1] "tive"  "tual"  "d"     "dress"
```

```r
str_sub(words[10:13], 3, 5)
```

```
## [1] "tiv" "tua" "d"   "dre"
```

```r
str_sub(words[10:13], -3)
```

```
## [1] "ive" "ual" "add" "ess"
```

----
## substrings: base


```r
substr(words[10:13], 3, nchar(words[10:13]))
```

```
## [1] "tive"  "tual"  "d"     "dress"
```

```r
substr(words[10:13], 3, 5)
```

```
## [1] "tiv" "tua" "d"   "dre"
```

```r
substr(words[10:13], nchar(words[10:13]) - 2, nchar(words[10:13]))
```

```
## [1] "ive" "ual" "add" "ess"
```

----
## A few more substrings with stringr


```r
words[10:13]
```

```
## [1] "active"  "actual"  "add"     "address"
```

Extract the second to second to last characters


```r
str_sub(words[10:13], 2, -2)
```

```
## [1] "ctiv"  "ctua"  "d"     "ddres"
```

Use to modify


```r
str_sub(words[10:13], 2, 4) <- "XX"
words[10:13]
```

```
## [1] "aXXve"  "aXXal"  "aXX"    "aXXess"
```

----
## Locate where strings occur


```r
fruit[c(1, 62, 2:5)]
```

```
## [1] "apple"       "pineapple"   "apricot"     "avocado"     "banana"     
## [6] "bell pepper"
```

```r
str_locate(fruit[c(1, 62, 2:5)], "ap")
```

```
##      start end
## [1,]     1   2
## [2,]     5   6
## [3,]     1   2
## [4,]    NA  NA
## [5,]    NA  NA
## [6,]    NA  NA
```

---- 
## Trim white space


```r
white_space <- c(" before", "after ", " both ")
```

# stringr


```r
str_trim(white_space)
```

```
## [1] "before" "after"  "both"
```

```r
str_trim(white_space, side = "left")
```

```
## [1] "before" "after " "both "
```

```r
str_trim(white_space, side = "right")
```

```
## [1] " before" "after"   " both"
```


# base


```r
trimws(white_space)
```

```
## [1] "before" "after"  "both"
```

```r
trimws(white_space, which = "left")
```

```
## [1] "before" "after " "both "
```

```r
trimws(white_space, which = "right")
```

```
## [1] " before" "after"   " both"
```

----
## Pad white space
# stringr
(we won't talk about base, but it's `sprintf` if you're interested)


```r
strings <- c("abc", "abcdefg")
```


```r
str_pad(strings, 10)
```

```
## [1] "       abc" "   abcdefg"
```

```r
str_pad(strings, 10, side = "right")
```

```
## [1] "abc       " "abcdefg   "
```

```r
str_pad(strings, 10, side = "both")
```

```
## [1] "   abc    " " abcdefg  "
```


----
## Pad w/something else


```r
string_nums <- as.character(1:15)
string_nums
```

```
##  [1] "1"  "2"  "3"  "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10" "11" "12" "13" "14"
## [15] "15"
```


```r
str_pad(string_nums, 3, pad = "0")
```

```
##  [1] "001" "002" "003" "004" "005" "006" "007" "008" "009" "010" "011"
## [12] "012" "013" "014" "015"
```

---- 
# Special characters


----
## What you see isn't always what R sees


```r
fox <- "the quick \nbrown fox \n \t jumps over the \t lazy dog"
fox
```

```
## [1] "the quick \nbrown fox \n \t jumps over the \t lazy dog"
```
* The above code has special characters telling R to break for a new line `\n` and to tab over `\t`. 
* You can see how R "sees" the data using the `base::writeLines()` function

----

```r
writeLines(fox)
```

```
## the quick 
## brown fox 
##  	 jumps over the 	 lazy dog
```
* `\n` and `\t` are probably the two most common.
* Use `?"'"` to see others

----
## Special symbols


```r
symbols <- c("\u03B1", "\u03B2", "\u03B3", "\u03B4", "\u03B5", "\u03B6")
symbols
```

```
## [1] "α" "β" "γ" "δ" "ε" "ζ"
```

These are called unicode characters and are consistent across programming languages. You can do plenty of other symbols outside of greek too. For example `"\u0807"` turns into ࠇ. 

See http://graphemica.com/unicode/characters/ to find specific numbers

----
## You might be thinking... Plots!
* Better ways to do that
* Let's create some normal distributions and annotate the plot


```r
x <- seq(-5, 5, .1)
l1 <- dnorm(x, 0, 1)
l2 <- dnorm(x, 0, 2)
l3 <- dnorm(x, 0, 3)

d <- data.frame(x = x, 
				likelihood = c(l1, l2, l3), 
				sd = rep(1:3, each = length(x)))
```

----
## Let's annotate this plot


```r
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_classic())
ggplot(d, aes(x, likelihood, color = factor(sd))) + geom_line()
```

![plot of chunk basic_plot](../assets/fig/basic_plot-1.png)


----

```r
ggplot(d, aes(x, likelihood, color = factor(sd))) + 
	geom_line() +
	annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.41, label = "sigma == 1", parse = TRUE, 
		color = "#F8766D") +
	annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.22, label = "sigma == 2", parse = TRUE, 
		color = "#00BA38") +
	annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0.15, label = "sigma == 3", parse = TRUE, 
		color = "#619CFF")
```

![plot of chunk plot_annotate](../assets/fig/plot_annotate-1.png)

----
## Base plot annotations

* Use `expression` with no quotes


```r
splt <- split(d, d$sd)

plot(splt[[1]]$x, splt[[1]]$likelihood, 
	type = "l", 
	col = "#F8766D", 
	bty = "n", 
	xlab = "data", 
	ylab = "likelihood", 
	lwd = 2)
lines(splt[[2]]$x, splt[[2]]$likelihood, col = "#00BA38", lwd = 2)
lines(splt[[3]]$x, splt[[3]]$likelihood, col = "#619CFF", lwd = 2)

text(0, 0.41, expression(sigma == 1), col = "#F8766D")
text(0, 0.21, expression(sigma == 2), col = "#00BA38")
text(0, 0.14, expression(sigma == 3), col = "#619CFF")
```

----
![plot of chunk expression_noecho](../assets/fig/expression_noecho-1.png)


----
## Escaping special characters
* If you want the literal text to show up, instead of the symbol, you have to escape it it `\`. 
* Because `\` itself is a special character, that means you need two: `\\`. 


```r
show_symbols <- c("\\u03B1", "\\u03B2", "\\u03B3", "\\u03B4", "\\u03B5", "\\u03B6")
show_symbols
```

```
## [1] "\\u03B1" "\\u03B2" "\\u03B3" "\\u03B4" "\\u03B5" "\\u03B6"
```

* There are also a host of regular expressions that have special characters that you'll need to escape if you want them to print too. We'll talk more about these later.
