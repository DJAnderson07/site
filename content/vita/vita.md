## [Teaching](../teaching)
I teach graduate courses in quantitative methods, usually with a data science focus, using R. I regularly post the materials from my courses on this website, which can be found by following the *Teaching* link.

## [Publications](../publications)
My publications to date have mostly been focused in the area of Educational Measurement. I have co-authored 10 peer-reviewed journal articles, with 6 as lead author.


## [Conference Presentations](../conference_pres)
I have co-authored 28 conference presentations, including lead author and presenter of 15 conference presentations. The majority of my conference presentations have been made at the annual meetings of the *National Council on Measurement in Education* (NCME) or the *American Educational Research Association*. 

## [Software Development](../software)
I occasionally develop software in R. All of my software development, as well as much of my other coding work, can be found on my [github](https://github.com/DJAnderson07) page.
