# Discussion 

* How does this effect teaching?

--

* Are data outside of education relevant? (e.g., twitter, facebook)

--

* How can we harness the data to help improve education? (think broadly and "outside the box")

---
# Taking a step back
* I Discuss these data sources because it's what **I am interested in**.
* Many data sources we are interested in are not just "out there" in 
educational research. 
* What are some other ways data might be collected?

---
# Planned data collection efforts
* Observations
  + Structured or unstructured

--

* Interviews

--

* Focus groups

--

* Assessments

.gray[(what I personally work with the most)]

--

* Surveys

# Research Ethics

--
(It should be about 5:15)

---
class: inverse

# Ethical Principles

.Large[
1. Respect

1. Beneficience

1. Justice

]

---
# Respect
* Allow participants choice about participating
* Minimize harm
* Maintain confidentiality

---
# Beneficience
* How will the study benefit *participants* (not society/students/schools, etc.)?
* How will the reserach benefit society/students/schools?
  + Do the benefits outweigh the risks? 

--

(are you sure?)

&lt;br/&gt;

![](assets/img/detective.jpeg)

---
# Justice
Who *should* benefit from the study? Do the participants match this population?

* Focus on overcoming your own inherent biases

---
# Case study
Let's look at a study together!

.gray[(Not in education, but a good example anyway)]

![](assets/img/gerber.png)

# Quick summary

* Authors wanted to see if voter turnout could be increased by malleable factors
* Sample: 180,002 households in Michigan
* Voter turnout observed for half the sample (99,999). No Treatment Control.
* Other half randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions

# Condition 1: Civic Duty

# Results

![](assets/img/gerber_results.png)

---
# Discussion time

* Look at the study in more depth with your group (3-4 people)
* Discuss the ethics of this study: Respect, Beneficience, Justice
* Keep in mind, there are no correct/incorrect responses here. This study was published in 2008 and would likely still pass IRB today.
* After 15 minutes we'll de-brief

# Quantitative Research
* [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research): "the systematic empricial investigation of observable phenomena via statistical, mathematical or computational techniques."

* Basically:
  * Measure something you're interested in quantitatively (dependent variable)
  * Measure other things you're interested in that may relate to the DV (i.e., did they receive treatment? Yes = 1, No = 0) and anything else relevant to the study
  * Analyze the data to make inferences about the study/phenomena

# Qualitative Research

--

![](https://media-cdn.sueddeutsche.de/image/sz.1.2716352/640x360?v=1519613542000)

---
(okay, okay...)

--

* In-depth observations, interviews, focus groups
* Non-numerical data (but still plenty of data)
* Can be used to understand a specific phenomena at much greater depths
* Often used for theory *building* rather than theory *testing*

---
# Single Case
.pull-left[
* Not actually a single subject, but usually a small *n*
* Varied designs, all aimed at making *causal* inferences by manipulation of an IV
* Rely heavily on visual analysis
* Most common designs:
  * AB
  * Reversal (ABA) Designs
  * Multiple baseline

# Pop Quiz
* What is survey research?

--

Trick question - could be quantiative or qualitative.

---
# What about analyzing text?
* Say... responses to an interview

--

Generally this would be qualitative research, and the text would be *coded* for themes by the qualitative researcher(s)

--


**BUT!** 

--

Could also be quantitative

---
# Example of mining twitter data
* ~15,000 tweets collected during the height of the parent-child separation border crisis
* Most common three-word phrases

&lt;img src="assets/img/trigrams.png" style="height:375px"&gt;

# Group work (15 minutes)

.gray[It should be about 6:30]

For each of the below, describe a qualitative and quantitative approach to studying the particular phenomena

* Bullying
* Teacher effectiveness
* Racial discrimination
* A behavioral intervention designed to reduce school-wide violence
* An academic intervention designed to help studnets learn fractions

# Validity

It should be about 7:15

---
# What is validity?
* The truth of, correctness of, or degree of support for an inference
* Inferences are or are not valid (not the study, method, measure, etc.)

--

.pull-left[
### Internal validity

How trustworthy are the results of the study?
]

--

.pull-right[
### External validity

To what extent do the results generalize beyond the specific sample used in the study?
]

---
## Internal Validity

--

* Degree to which study conclusions are warranted

--

* Degree to which plausible rival explanations are ruled out

--

* Are the results of the study *really* due to the phenomena under investigation

---
## Threats to Validity

* Any specific reason an inference could be partly or totally wrong
  + Difficulty to assess all plausible threats a priori
* Specific designs are more susceptible than others

---
## Threats to Internal Validity

From Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002

In sets of Three. Why? ðŸ¤·

--

1. Ambiguous temporal precendence

--

  + Lack of clarity as to which occured first

--

1. Selection

--

  + Systematic differences over conditions that could result in the observed effect

--
  
1. History

--

  + Events occuring concurently w/treatment that could result in the observed effect
  
---

1. Maturation

--

  + Naturally occuring changes that could be confused with treatment
  
--

1. Regression

--

  + Extreme scores naturally migrating toward the mean
  
--

1. Attrition

--

  + Non-random loss of participants
  
---

1. Testing

--

  + Exposure to a test can effect subsequent test scores
  
--

1. Instrumentation

--

  + Psychometric concerns
  
--

1. Additive and Interactive Effects

--

  + Impact of one threat may be added to another, or depend on the level of another
  
--

1. Diffusion

--
  + Members of the control/comparison group receive the treatment


.gray[Okay, so this one had four]

---
# External Validity
* Not to be confused with internal validity

&gt; "concerns inferences about the extent to which a causal relationship holds over variations in persons, settings, treatments, and outcomes" (p. 83)

---
# Threats to External Validity

1. Interaction of the causal relationship with units

--

  + Effect is found with certain kinds of units but not others
  + Works for boys, what about girls?
  
--

1. Interaction of the causal relationship over treatment variations

--

  + An effect found with some variations, but not others
  + Reducing class size may only work when accompanied by new funding to build new classrooms
  
--

1. Interaction of the causal relationship over outcomes

--

  + An effect observed with one outcome (easyCBM math), doesn't hold for others (state math test)

---

1. Interaction over settings

--
  
  + An effect found in one setting does not generalize to others
  + urban/rural
  
--

1. Context-dependent mediation

--

  + A mediator of the causal relation may be present in one context, but not another

# Any time left?
* Get documents uploaded to canvas, then:
    + Start working on finding articles
    + Use me! I'm here to help!

---
# Before next class
* Get your work from today uploaded to canvas
* Complete the human subjects training
* Read: Kerlinger &amp; Lee

### Begin searching for articles for final project 

(make a goal to find at least 1)
 
* We'll discuss measurement and sampling procedures to help control for threats to validity
