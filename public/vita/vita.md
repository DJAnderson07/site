# Teaching
I am currently in the process of developing a five-course data science specialization in R for students in the College of Education at the University of Oregon, in collaboration with Drs. [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io), [Chester Ismay](http://ismayc.github.io) and [Andrew Bray](http://andrewpbray.github.io). Although the courses will be offered through the COE, it is anticipated that students from numerous social science departments will have an interest, given past enrollment in the R courses listed below.
