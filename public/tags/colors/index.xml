      <description>This is the fourth and (probably) final post in a series of posts about estimating, visualizing, exploring, and now modeling achievement gap variation between schools using publicly available data.
Let’s start by loading the data directly from my website. The code below should provide you with achievement gap data
library(tidyverse) d &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;https://github.com/datalorax/site/raw/master/content/post/v-geocoded.csv&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% mutate_at(vars(v, Longitude, Latitude), as.numeric) Introduction and background What we’d really like to do is understand how much geography accounts for achievement gap variability.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking some time off work this week to be with my two girls in their final week of summer. But in that time I started playing around with colors in R a bit and wanted to share some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, specifically in relation to bivariate color palettes. There is an existing R package, {biscale}, which is probably the simplest way to approach this, but I wanted to dig in a bit more and explore on my own.</description>
