<h2 id="before-we-get-started">Before we get started</h2>

<ul>
<li>In many cases, I&rsquo;ve opted to show both base and <em>stringr</em> functions</li>
<li><em>stringr</em> is part of the tidyverse, and has some nice functionality, but many of the base functions are so common I think I&rsquo;d be doing you a disservice if I didn&rsquo;t also introduce them.</li>
<li>There are some <em>stringr</em> functions that are far easier than the base alternative, so I&rsquo;ll skip base on them (e.g., <code>str_extract()</code>).</li>

<h2 id="some-properties-of-strings">Some properties of strings</h2>

<ul>
<li>Strings can be anything wrapped in quotes</li>

&quot;4.78&quot;

<ul>
<li>Strings are the most flexible data type. Can be coerced to other types if it makes sense
(the below spits out warnings)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vectors-must-be-of-the-same-type">Vectors must be of the same type</h2>

<ul>
<li>This implies that if you have a character element in an atomic vector, all will be coerced to character (because it&rsquo;s the most flexible)</li>
